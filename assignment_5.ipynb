Some of the functions are meant to test if the algorithm gets **stuck in local optimums**, some check if the algorithm can find optimums **bordering** the function domain, some functions are symetric while some highly asymetric and so on and so forth. We have to take this properties in to account when chosing our algorithms to optimize the search."

    "## **ALGORITHM 1:** Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm was chosen as the **first one** we tested, under the assumtion it is often wildly used and works for functions that behave well. One big problem is the differentiability of the functions which is not always favourable and is sometimes time consuming so we used an **approximation**. 15 out of the 17 functions with description are described as **differentiable** so it is worth analysing this approach, even though it is a bit naive because it only performs well for smooth, convex, unimodal functions. The problem with this aproach is also that it has a big possibility of getting stuck in a **local minimum**. We will be solving this problem by adding a random component to it, making the algorithm go through **more iterations** starting at **different points** chosen uniformly at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we start in a randomly chosen point and compute the **gradient** for that set of coordinates. The function **``gradient_approximation``** takes care of that. Instead of differentiating each variable, we use two points that are 0.01 apart. Because this is the direction of the **biggest increase** for the function we are trying to optimize we compute the next point by going in the opposite direction of the mentioned increase. This is the equation $x_n = x_{n-1} - \\alpha \\cdot \\bigtriangleup G(x_n)$ where $\\bigtriangleup G$ is the gradient of the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question that arises in this proposition is what is the **step size** in this direction? Let's look at the **``alpha``** parameter in the code bellow. Now there are many ways to find this scalar, the optimal one would be finding the one that **minimizes** the equation: $G(x_{n-1} - \\alpha \\cdot \\bigtriangleup G(x_n))$. This would take a lot of time because we are working with 40 dimentions and after some observations one can notice the elements of the gradients sometimes tend to be very different in size. We tackled with this problem by making the step size for each partial derivative different making it **between 0 and 1** for every single one. This also solves a lot of domain breach problems. We wrapped all of this up in a function that creates the new point **``new_point``**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE***: This algorithm is quite **time consuming** for all 24 functions, because we have to calculate the **gradient approximation**."

    "This was the **second one** algorithm. The reason behind this one was the fact that these functions are very different, so the idea of some improved **random search** could work if we are trying to get the best possible result for all functions even though this could mean cutting some loses at those more specific ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for a quick summery of how this algorithm works. We start with random points for each function. At every iteration of the algorithm take a **random step** between -0.1 and 0.1 for all 40 dimensions and check whether this **neighbour** produces a **better objective value**. Now in order not to get stuck in a **local minimum** we decide to move to this new point even if the solution is **worse** with some **probability** that is getting smaller with each iteration. This probability is regulated with a parameter called **``temperature``**. The higher the temperature the bigger the probability of accepting the bad solution, the more search space we explore. The lower the temperature, the more we focus on the solution at hand and optimizing this one. \n",

    "2. if the difference is a negative one then the solution is better and we accept and save it - this is now our current position\n",
    "3. otherwise we accept the probability with the Boltzmann distribution: $P = e^{\\cfrac {\\bigtriangleup} {temperature}}$\n",
